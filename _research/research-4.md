<!-- IPNLâ€‹ implements the autoware package to realize a low-speed AGV. The localization, guidance, and control functions are self-developed. This research aims to gain an understanding of the whole AGV system for IPNL members. The wire-controllable vehicle is donated by [iDriverpuls](https://www.idriverplus.com/cn/index.html) which is a successful startup company -->

## Abstract
In this project, we aim to implement the autonomous robotic systems, such as the autonomous driving vehicles (ADV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) **with the objectives of**: (1) **lead impact to the applications and even the society using the developed research achievements from IPNL**. (2) **explore new scientific problems from autonomous robotic systems by doing real implementation**. (3) **train different levels of students with interests in the autonomous robotic systems**.

## Recent News
- Sept 2022, we welcome the **PolyU Campus Facilities and Sustainability Office (CFSO)** and **Health and Safety Office (HSO)** to attend the demonstration of AAE/CFSO Campus Security Patrol with Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)
