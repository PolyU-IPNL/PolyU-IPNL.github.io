## Abstract 
The **visual/LiDAR SLAM methods are challenged in complex urban scenarios**. In this project, we aim to study the mechanism of the impacts cuased by the dynamic scenarios on the visual/LiDAR SLAM methods. We try to answer the quesitons of how the dynamic objects affect the state estimation of visual/LiDAR SLAM methods and how to improve.
