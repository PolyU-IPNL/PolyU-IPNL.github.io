## Abstract
Positioning in urban environments is becoming essential due to the increasing demand for autonomous driving vehicles (ADV). The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is currently one of the principal means of providing globally-referenced positioning for ADV localization. With the increased availability of multiple satellite constellations, GNSS can provide satisfactory performance in open-sky areas. However, the positioning accuracy is significantly degraded in highly-urbanized cities such as Hong Kong, due to signal reflection caused by static buildings and dynamic objects such as double-decker buses. If the direct light-of-sight (LOS) is blocked, and reflected signals from the same satellite are received, the notorious non-light-of-sight (NLOS) receptions occur. According to a recent review paper, NLOS is currently the major difficulty in the use of GNSS in intelligent transportation systems. Because of NLOS receptions, the performance of GNSS positioning is highly influenced by real-time surrounding environmental features, such as buildings and dynamic objects. Therefore, effectively sensing and understanding surrounding environments is the key to improve GNSS positioning in urban areas, as GNSS positioning relies heavily on sky view visibility. 

Inspired by the strong perception capability of ADV using onboard sensors (such as 3D LiDAR), we continuously developed the perception-aided NLOS mitigation methods where the 3D LiDAR is employed to timely reconstruct the surrounding environments to identify the NLOS receptions. The idea was also reported in the industrial magazine in 2018. The work was further improved in 2020, where several drawbacks are relaxed and was awarded the Best Presentation Award in the session of Navigation in Urban Environments. Interestingly, this award is selected by the session chairs from Waymo (a company focused on the realization of L4 autonomous driving) and Swift Navigation (a company that focused on GNSS precise positioning solutions). Meanwhile, the idea is transferred into industrial applications for high-accuracy offline mapping applications. However, the accuracy from GNSS single point positioning is still limited due to the systematic errors, such as clock and atmospheric errors. Recently, we extended the LiDAR aided GNSS NLOS mitigation to the GNSS Real-time Kinematic (RTK), leading to sub-meter level accuracy. Unfortunately, the fixed rate of the RTK is still not guaranteed as: 
  - The exisitng method does not fully mitigate the NLOS with multiple reflections and multipath. It is still **an unknown questions to model the multiple reflection and multipath**. 
  - Poor satellite geometry due to the signal blockage and potential NLOS exclusion. It is still an unknown question to **effective improve the geometry of the satellite constraints in dense urban canyons**.
