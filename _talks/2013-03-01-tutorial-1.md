The team from ASTRI (Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Company Limited) visited IPNL lab on 24 October2022. The team leader from ASTRI is Dongzhe Su who is quite experienced in the V2X and infraustructure aided sensing. 

We discussed several ideas for the potential collaboration on urban Sensing and navigation with intelligent infrastructure. One of our insight is to make use of the infraustructure to help with the high definition map development. In addition, the map udpate can also be assisted by the infraustructure. Our PhD students Feng Huang and Runzhi Hu are working on this!
