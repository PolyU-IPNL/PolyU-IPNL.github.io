Invited by [Prof. steffen schön](https://www.ife.uni-hannover.de/en/institute/team/steffen-schoen/). We visit the research team at [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/de/) during 4th Dec 2022 to 10th Dec 2022. Thank you very much for the invitation from [Dr. Hsu](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-lt-hsu/) and [Dr. Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-guohao-zhang/) as well! I learned a lot from the visiting! 

- Hanover is a lovely and quiet city 
- People there are friendly and warm :-)
- The food in Hanover city is quite different but still quite new to me
