We are demonstrating the autonomous driving technologies developed in the past 5 years in PolyU to the visitors from a high school of Hong Kong. Those students showed strong interest in the autonomous driving system. During the test, the 3D LiDAR and camera is employed to percepive the environments. We are quite shocked by the high school students as they ask some very insightful quesitons on the autonomous vehicles. In addition, the students also ask the questions on the ubuntu systems as some of them even have experience on programming with the C++ and participating in the competitions. 

Big thanks to Feng Huang and Yihan Zhong for their hard work on preparing the demonstration. Thank you very much for the continuous help from Dr. Hsu!
