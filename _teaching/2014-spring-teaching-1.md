This is undergraduate level class delivering the content of GNSS positioning including the single point positioning (SPP), differential GNSS and real-time kinematic positioning. Also, the visual positioning is also introduced. The state estimation methods using Kalman filtering, factor graph optimization are also introduced. This lecture also include two tutorials and massive hand-writing examples to demonstrate the navigation technique for the autonomous systems. The Subject Description Form can can be found in [AAE website](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/-/media/department/aae/publication/subject-list---2022/undergraduate/sdf_aae4203_guidance-and-navigation_20220103.pdf).
